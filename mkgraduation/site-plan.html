        This site is essentially an online store. Online shopping is a convenient way to shop while in the comfort of your own home. Especially during a busy season like graduation season, shopping for stoles and leis in person is a bit difficult. My site allows visitors to browse the online store and purchase any items they want. Like any online store, this site requires payment and shipping information in order for visitors to receive the items they are wanting to purchase. This site requires payment information because in order to make a purchase, you need to the financial funds to pay for the products. The shipping information is so that we send the products to the correct place. There is nothing worse than buying an item for a specific occasion (like a graduation) and the product does not make it to the correct location.

        When you google “leis,” the first thing you see is the fake leis that people would buy as decorations for a party. Those type of leis are fun, but I do not see them suitable for memorable occasions such as graduations. Real flowers are a lot better. They not only look better, but it also smells amazing. People will come to my site because it is different from what they would usually see. The leis are not your typical Hawaiian leis and these stoles are not the boring single colored stoles that you see on Amazon. This site offers one-of-a-kind leis and haku leis (crown leis). They are handmade and are sure to grab the attention of everyone in the stadium. This site also offers a selection of graduation stoles. These graduation stoles are inspired from flags and different cultures. This allows for graduates to represent their cultures and countries of origin. I think that people will want to visit my site because it is unique. These items will definitely catch the eye of people. It will make people visit the site and hopefully entice them to make purchases. The overall look of the site, I am trying to make it eye-catching, but subtle so that it does not overwhelm people. Honestly, I do not know why visitors would come to my site instead of another. I think it all comes down to whether or not the visitor is interested in the products. If they are interested, then they would definitely purchase the products. If they are not interested, they will not waste anymore time on this site.

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        There are two main categories of questions visitors may have. I am sure visitors may have several questions about the products and who we are as a brand. I promise you that this site will answer those questions. The first category of questions is product based. It answers the questions of pricing and specifications. One question this site will answer is “What kind of flower is used for the leis?” Another question for the products category would be, “What flags do you have for the stoles?” Each product has their specifications listed so that visitors know what they are buying. The second category of questions is company based. Some visitors may have questions about the company regarding authenticity. An example of a company-based question is “Who is MK?” Another example would be, “How did the owners of MK come up with the idea for their company?” For those who want to know more about MK, there is an “About Us” page that explains who MK is. The “About Us” page can also help visitors gain trust in the company. When a company gains the trust of their customers and other visitors, that company is able to grow and they are able to get more business.
