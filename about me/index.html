    <h2>Leti</h2>
    <p>Hey, Hi, Hello! My name is Valetty, but I go by Leti. I love to listen to music, watch Netflix documentaries and play board games with my cousins.</p>
    <p>I recently switched my major to Applied Technology. I currently work for an airline and enjoy it. Maybe someday I'll change my career, but as of right now, I just want to learn as much as I can.</p>
    <p>I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints for my entire life. My favorite quote is from Elder Jeffrey R. Holland, "Believe in miracles. ... Hope is never lost."</p>
    <p>I'm excited for the semester and look forward to getting to know you all.</p>
